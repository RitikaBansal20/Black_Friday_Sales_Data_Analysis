### Introduction
Black Friday is a shopping holiday  that takes place on the day after Thanksgiving. It is known for its deep discounts and special deals on a wide range of products, including electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. Many retailers offer special doorbuster deals and extended hours on Black Friday, and it is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Our project deals with determining the product prices based on the historical retail store sales data. After generating the predictions, our model will help the retail store to decide the price of the products to earn more profits.

### Dataset Description
The dataset that we are having contains 537578 rows and 12 columns.

Our main goal will be to do various kind of analysis and get inferences which will be able to help to provide valuable insights on the market and hence will be beneficial for the company.


### Analysing Phase
The project will be divided into the following 7 parts:

* Dataset Walkthrough
* Analyzing Columns
* Analyzing Gender
* Analysing Age & Marital Status
* Multi Column Analysis
* Occupation and Products Analysis
* Combining Gender & Marital Status

###  EDA:
The observations we've drawn from the data visualisation carried out as part of the Data Understanding process are listed below:
* Approximately, male users make 75% of the purchases, and female users make the remaining 25%. The majority of the retail store's sales are credited, according to this, to male customers. When you sum up the entire cost of all purchases, you can see that, on average, men spend more money on purchases than women do. This was produced using the data visualisation work carried out as part of the Data Understanding process.
* Single Men spend the most money on Black Friday, according to our analysis of Purchase and Marital Status. Additionally, it reveals that once men get married, they tend to spend less. It can be as a result of the new responsibilities.
* In terms of the Age feature, we found that consumers between the ages of 25 and 40 tend to spend the most.
* There's a fascinating column,  After examining the column Stay In Current City Years, we discovered that those who have been in the city for a 1 year tend to spend the most. This makes sense because those who have lived in a city for more than four years tend to be more settled and less interested in purchasing new items than those who have recently moved there, who tend to purchase more.
* Surprisingly, when we looked at the location in which the goods was purchased, we found that while city B accounts for the majority of the total sales revenue, the product in question was primarily purchased in city C.
